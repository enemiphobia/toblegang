just a *small* project i'm working on related to **content creation**

it's on my school account because i can't get visual studio code to sign out

eh all my projects are on here so i might as well use this

it's just a **hobby related thing** tho nothing *school related*

Notes for me --------------------------------------------------------------

`Goals:

* add everyone i need to hall of fame
* implement mobile-support
* redo the footer (socials bar looks wack)
`

To add someone to the hall of fame:
* just add a paragraph element and type something in it
(make sure it's within the "awesomePPL" div and the "box" div")
